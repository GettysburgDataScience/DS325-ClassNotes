# Mini-Project 1 (and examples!)
Due Friday October 17, 2025 at 5p

A data story is a structured narrative that combines data, visualizations, and/or text to communicate meaningful insights. Generally, data stories highlight some aspect of the data, revealing patterns or trends to convince an audience of some conclusion or call to action. 

Data stories might be single infographics, articles, videos, tweets, or blog posts. Find a recently published data story (from the past year); data should be presented in some visual way, a graph or table of some sort. Answer the questions on the report template linked below. You may have more to say for some questions than others. In writing your report, delete the question prompts but number your responses accordingly.
