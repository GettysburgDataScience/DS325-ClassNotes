    "*Correlation* between two variables conveys the extent of a linear relationship between the two variables. The *correlation coefficient *, $\\rho$, ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    " - $\\rho = 1$ is a perfect positive correlation. One variable is exactly linearly related to the other with positive slope.\n",
    " - $\\rho = -1$ is a perfect negative correlation. One variable is exactly linearly related to the other with negative slope.\n",
    " - $\\rho = 0$ suggests the two variables are completely uncorrelated.\n",
    " - $0 < |\\rho| < 1$ suggests some correlation. The two variables might be linearly related, but not exactly due to noisy measurements, non-linearities, unconsidered factors, etc. What is considered good correlation varies from domain to domain.\n",

    " We will want to select features that are correlated to the target value.\n",
