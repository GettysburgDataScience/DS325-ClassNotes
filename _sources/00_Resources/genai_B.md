## Follow-up questions: In the classroom
- What is the value of knowing things? Knowing how to do things?
  - Knowledge is power.
  - Good for baseline how to do things. Not good for higher level interpretation.
- What are productive uses of GenAI?
  - Research tool. Layout, brainstorming.
  - Help study.
  - Simplify content.
  - Help in maintaining syntax in coding (for example)
- What are counter-productive uses of GenAI?
  - Hinders work ethic.
  - Limits human connection, 'soft' skills.
- How does student usage of GenAI affect other students?
- How does student usage of GenAI affect instructors?
  - Easing the work of professors.
  - Instructors feel less motivated to give feedback (anger is the feeling)
- How does instructor usage of GenAI affect students?
- What are your responsibilities with using AI? What is proper usage? What should be the penalty for improper usage? 
  - The goal is to learn. Respect that goal.
- Have you discussed GenAI policy in other classes? What are the policies you've seen?
  - Econ 243: use as a tool to solve math problems.
  - Econometrics: generate ideas and brainstorm. Look for research.
